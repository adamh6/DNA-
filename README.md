This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run

In order to run the app you should first have Node.js installed, which can be found here:

https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once installed, run the Node Command Prompt and make sure you are in the app's directory, which should presumably look like yourPath/DNA--master.

Once in the directory, install the dependencies by running:

### `npm install`

This should take a few minutes. Once it's finished, run:

### `npm start`

And you should be able to run the app!

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
